## Snowflake Object Hierarchy
![Snowflake Object Hierarchy](./.images/snowflakeObjectHierarchy.png)

## Proposed GP application directory structure

The repository directory structure proposed here corresponds with the way in which Snowflake organizes these objects.  

Note: There are SF objects that don't require the context of a database.schema to create like External Storage Integrations (think pointers to s3 locations). However, from the standpoint of the Principle of Least Privilege we tend to manage these Snowflake objects at the schema level anyway. Why? Because we would never create an External Storage integration that points to an entire Georgia Pacific s3 bucket -right? We would instead create a SI that points to a data set -which corresponds to schema any way you look at it.

Some of these items like Masking Policies might very well be best stored in the ADM_CONTROL_DB with limited privileges.

```
mkdir -p ./apps/adm_control/{snowflake_objects/databases/schemas/tags_schema/{externalTables,fileFormats,maskingPolicies,pipes,stages,streams,tables,tasks,views,sequences,storedProcedures,udfs,streams,tasks},scripts};

mkdir -p ./apps/adm_control/{snowflake_objects/databases/schemas/alerts_schema/{externalTables,fileFormats,maskingPolicies,pipes,stages,streams,tables,tasks,views,sequences,storedProcedures,udfs,streams,tasks},scripts};

-- "ENTER YOUR APPLICATION HERE" will be a 3 char "business segment", an underscore, then application name.  
-- For instance a "segment" called ADM and an "application" called "CONTROL" might have two schemas, "ALERTS" AND "TAGS" would have these as mkdir commands:  

mkdir -p ./apps/adm_control/{snowflake_objects/databases/adm_control_db/schemas/alerts/{externalTables,fileFormats,maskingPolicies,pipes,stages,streams,tables,tasks,views,sequences,storedProcedures,udfs,streams,tasks},scripts};

mkdir -p ./apps/adm_control/{snowflake_objects/databases/adm_control_db/schemas/tags/{externalTables,fileFormats,maskingPolicies,pipes,stages,streams,tables,tasks,views,sequences,storedProcedures,udfs,streams,tasks},scripts};
```

## Functional Role Descriptions
- This isn't real. I got the data from Gitlab docs and found the table formatter online. Roles and Descriptions might be worth comparing to our Functional Roles. But the formatter from table data in Excel is worth using!!
